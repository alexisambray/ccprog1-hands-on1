# Cost Splitting with Friends
For this problem you develop a program that will help the group compute how much each of them will have to chip in to cover the costs. 
It should also include a way to recalculate how much to chip in, in the event a member backs out at the last minute due to emergencies.

```NOTE```: Assume that inputs are numbers only! You do not have to handle errors caused by an inputted different data type value. 
(eg. Entering a character value)

## Example 
Enter no. of people in the group: ```12```
Enter total cost of the party: ```7500.00```
Number of people backing out: ```3```

Original contribution per person: ```625.00```
Added contribution per person due to backout: ```208.33```
Recomputed contribution per person: ```833.33```
